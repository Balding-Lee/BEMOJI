"get the feeling this is will be hard to define moving forward as elements are fundamentally defined differently under html5. from what gather from reading html5, elements aren't really defined by **block** content anymore, but are defined by **flow** content. **inline** seems to be denoted by **phrasing** content. furthermore, things like the anchor tag are actually [**transparent**](http which means they can hold **flow** content as well, in certain situations. because why not have ambiguous elements  guess this moves into what do the browsers default them to. in the case of details, it is [block](http --- don't think most parsers distinguish between block vs inline as they don't care, so finding parser to do this for us might not be possible. mozilla seems to list [**block** level elements](https but you will notice that /code/ is not listed under block. this is because html5 no longer uses those terms. but it *is* under [**flow** content](https (but so is the anchor tag 😦 ). --- so in short ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.",😠,0

"great to hear that it works for you, too!  imho *increasing* the percentage is normally done via the developer console as most developers visit it directly before doing that to check that there were no critical bugs or user feedback which would prevent further rollout. of course one could think about automating these checks as well in that case an increase-task would be really nice. however i'm not completely sure about the real demand for such feature.",😌,1

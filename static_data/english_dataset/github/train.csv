thanks for catching this @lyzadanger  that link probably broke when we switched the docs over to gitbook. we could continue to link to the markdown version of the cli documentation (https or the full documentation site (https redirects to the correct page in the gitbook). my instinct is for linking the gitbook docs to avoid breaking the links if the file structure changes in the /code/ repo again. would like to get @frijol's feedback on that idea as well.,👏,1
"got it working, not an issue with either the plugin or the file, was the imagemagick install in my case. first time around didn't have imagemagick installed (you might want to add in the readme little note saying you should have that installed and on the path), but installing it didn't solve the issue either, nor did relaunching cmd or reboot. much bantering back and forth, crashed on ubuntu for other reasons (gruntfile fail), removed imagemagick and re-installed, and then it started working. so to others struggling, make sure imagemagick is on your path and working (test it by typing /code/ and you should get long list of possible options, and then it should work. to make it bit easier to spot stuff like this in the future, you should probably add some error checking to your function calls, this was the line 71 /code/ call that failed, and the error object was passed to your function (and the /code/ arg was thus undefined), so checking for err before using size could have at least provided us with enoent error, which is thus easier to backtrack to failing spawn, which again hints towards imagemagick.

"maybe went totally crazy with this (please tell me ). but let's break it down ### why besides supporting non javascript browsers (maybe you want to create .onion website, for example), there're some cases when you can't send an ajax request on the client. for example have post /users endpoint on my rest api. this endpoint is protected with secret key so other clients can't create users on my server. can't make an request on the client to this because it would expose the secret key. the best way have thought to solve the two problems above using the same form is letting /code/ to do its original job /code/ ### how **server.js** /code/ **registerform.js** /code/ **homepage.js** /code/ ### the problem need to submit the form inside the /code/ method, but have no reference to /code/ there. so start to look for /code/ action creator on /code/ but found that this is the only thing you can't do with an action  ### the solution had to create an action creator to submit the form. and i've published it on npm with this, changed the files **registerform.js** /code/ **homepage.js** /code/ if want to enable client request, have to simply add",😄,0

"#### description the attached project demonstrates the bug in the "". applecoloremojiui"" font. it appears that when an attributed string contains only the .applecoloremojiui font, the height ios reports for the attributed string (using [nsattributedstring boundingrectwithsize options context ]) is too short, and therefore the bounding box generated for the string will clip the bottom. as soon as string segment with taller font is added, done by appending any non-emoji character, the bounding box calculation is corrected. the other emoji font applecoloremoji does not appear to possess this height issue, hence the workaround to find-and-replace the font attribute. it's also unknown when ios 10 will decide to use .applecoloremojiui vs applecoloremoji when the [nsmutableattributedstring fixattributesinrange ""fixes"" the emoji characters to use the emoji font. steps to reproduce 1. add the string ""️"" to an nsmutableattributedstring and call [nsmutableattributedstring fixattributesinrange which will fix the emoji character attributes to possess the applecoloremojiui font. 2. then add this attributed string to any uikit text view. expected results non-clipped emoji. actual results the emojis will appear clipped at the bottom. version ios 10 notes configuration ios 10 iphone simulator product version 10 created 2016-09-28t18 35 43.553260 originated 2016-09-28t00 00 00 open radar link http",😔,0

solved thanks for the storm hint  actually the issue was there. the problem comes from my choice of the all-in-one monasca version (actually it lacks of docs in monasca-installer repo) instead of node monasca. so changed the /code/ file from master_config enable/disable services storm_nimbus_enabled false storm_supervisor_enabled true to master_config enable/disable services storm_nimbus_enabled true storm_supervisor_enabled true and in this way the complete storm was running on my vm. after that double checked the correctness by launching /code/ and /code/ both running. the /code/ ansible playbook passes that task  (stopped again later though  ... but this is another issue),😩,1

"@tsengsr pretty good points interesting reading about the crime attack  here's thing though the encryption provided by rebus (for messages at the moment, possibly also for data bus data later on) is not really meant to be hacker-proof. it is designed to work in way that provides just enough secrecy that e.g. developers and operations people can develop and maintain systems based on rebus and not accidentally get to read e.g. his colleague's payroll information or other semi-sensitive pieces of information. real-world analogue could be something like having lock on file cabinet in your company's financial or hr department if malicious employee wanted to break in and read up on his/her colleague's relatively sensitive pieces of information, the lock would not really provide any substantial protection, as it would be fairly easy to just break the file cabinet open and start reading. i bet many companies would even have the keys to the file cabinet lying in desk drawer right beside it. you could say that this kind of protection is more statement about secrecy than it is about providing real effective secrecy under all circumstances. my own informal tests on bunch of json messages reveal that doing the encryption",😁,1

"the direction this is taking refreshing break from the gaudy purple gradients and shadows from 2.x we've all become far too accustomed to, and not only that and more importantly, many ux tweaks, e.g. the settings button moved next to the rest of the menus, will help many users. too many times i've helped someone find the editor settings for them to say that they never even knew it existed on the top right. great work  to everyone who has worked on this thus far. 3.0 deserves an improved ui and fresh face to show off the amazing internals everyone has worked on in the engine. agreed @riirii, @alelepd currently has the concept that is easiest on the eyes, although if it was that direction, we may want to ease up on some rounded corners and make the coffee brown slightly less saturated. the dark blue would be nice optionally, but the current values of blue and green, especially the neon, highlights quickly wear on the eyes. in many ways, everyone is heading in good directions, but before it goes further, this can help reduce missteps and save some of everyone's precious free time spent on tweaking colors too",💕,1
